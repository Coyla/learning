Testing arduino project ðŸ“Ÿ
==

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Goal: Simulate a system that prevents someone that his is too close to some place or device. The system will prevent him by switch on a LED.

At a later stage, user will be able to turn on/off the system remotly via a web server.

**use case** can be used to prevent your child of dangerous place or device, like a hotplate ? 

## Steps
I divide the system into 3 separate system

- LED sys
- Presence/Distance sensor
- Web server

# Final prototype

In order to connect/plug PINS of the wifi card i used this diagram below.

LED + Distance sensor  + Wifi card

I set up a range distance of 40cm to active the LED.

# Test

Logs show that the server can get the distance from our system.

## Issues 
- Instead of set up the wifi card you need to **install the correct** driver, this is tricky, for me this one was a solution: CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers

- Sometimes, a wifi card PIN must be activated to switch to OUTPUT mode.

- I order to read and write data from arduino card at the sametime i need an asynchronous code.
