## Arrays

In memory, les elements d'un array sont stockés cote à cote
dans un seul/meme bloque de mémoire

Store many data in the same variable, and also sort/organize them if needed

For example, if we need to store 30 fruits, it's a bad idea to create 30 variables of fruits
to complecated to manipulate and manage

so we can store all fruits information in 1 same place/variable,
and if for example we need to sort alphabetically you can do it.

### Representation of arrays in memory


### Create

### Access

### Add/delete

### Some useful/common used functions/properties

### Specificites

### Multi dimensional array

Situations

### Examples

Each langage add some properties to 'Arrays'
for example in Python you array canont contain different element types 


Dont be confused by the different ways that each langage use for Array for, for example
Java has ArrayList word and List to create 'Array', some langage has shapes of Arrays, they sometime
call Array or List ... well it' depends of each Langage

ordered by an index

Array is generaly the word to talk about a data structure that can store many other datas, access easily, 
iterate and organize them in the same variable

Most of time all langages have 2 ways of create arrays
using [] and 'custructor' list new Array(3), and other langages have some shapes of arrays list ArrayList or List in Java


Basicaly this is an array ([] means array)

var frutsList = []
