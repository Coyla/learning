## Arrays


### What is it ? 

It's a kind of data structure, like a big tool box.

### Why we use it

Use it to store different or same data information in the SAME variable/place.

A basic reason: If your game/web application... needs to handle fruits, you need array to store all fruits names for example,
in order don't create a variable or each of fruits.

So each time we need to manage the concept of LIST, GROUP ... we need an array.

### How

Array provide functions and ways to manage them, like add, delete, find and pick up a specific
element or our array.

### Representation of arrays in memory

In memory, les elements d'un array sont stockés cote à cote
dans un seul/meme bloque de mémoire


### Create

### Access

### Add/delete

### Some useful/common used functions/properties

### Specificites

### Multi dimensional array

Situations

### Examples

Each langage add some properties to 'Arrays'
for example in Python you array canont contain different element types 


Dont be confused by the different ways that each langage use for Array for, for example
Java has ArrayList word and List to create 'Array', some langage has shapes of Arrays, they sometime
call Array or List ... well it' depends of each Langage

ordered by an index

Array is generaly the word to talk about a data structure that can store many other datas, access easily, 
iterate and organize them in the same variable

Most of time all langages have 2 ways of create arrays
using [] and 'custructor' list new Array(3), and other langages have some shapes of arrays list ArrayList or List in Java


Basicaly this is an array ([] means array)

var frutsList = []

### Common operation in array

#### Basic

Accès to specific element
Delete element by index
[remove elements in JavaScript](https://love2dev.com/blog/javascript-remove-from-array/)

The most used is splice and pop function in JavaScript
pop remove the last element of they array
splice allow you to remove an element starting from x index to n index. so you can remove 1 or more if you know the start index

Find an element

Iterate and using if condition

Get first and last element

Length of array to know how much time

pop -> pickup last
shift -> pickup first

push -> add at the end
unshift -> add at the end

JS allow you to put many element as argument of this functions

Insert element at n index

[how to add element](https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/javascript-add-to-array/)

Must used are using push/unshift and splice (removing 0 elements)

Contact

Using spread
arr.push(...new)
arr.contact(new)


JS a.contact(another)
This will return a new array

Clone array
Map array
Matrix iterate in two dimentional
Filter specific element

### common algorithms

Swap to elements without 3 variables

Reverse array 

Nombre pair le + petit

Intersection of array

Find Max and Minimum of unsorted array

Delete repeated numbers of array

Check if contains a number if they Array

Not the largest path in path matrix m*m
