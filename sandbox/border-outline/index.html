    <li> Outlines do not take up space, because they always placed on top of the box of the element which may cause them to overlap other elements on the page. </li>
 <li>Unlike borders, outlines won't allow us to set each edge to a different width, or set different colors and styles for each edge. An outline is the same on all sides.</li>
Outlines don't have any impact on surrounding elements apart from overlapping.
Unlike borders, outlines don't change the size or position of the element.
